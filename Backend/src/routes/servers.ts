/**
 * Lets the frontend offer a server picker before asking for any leaderboard - GET
 * /api/bosses/:id/leaderboard requires a serverId, and this is the only way to learn one.
 *
 * Per the user: this must list every server the CLIENT's own server-registration picker offers
 * (see server-catalog.ts/serverCatalog's own remarks), not just the ones that happen to have
 * already uploaded a fight - a server like EuroAion is real and selectable in the client today
 * even though nobody has uploaded from it yet. Left-joined against `servers` (matched by name,
 * the same string both tables use - "Origin Aion" in both) so a catalog entry that DOES already
 * have real uploads still resolves to its real serverId (needed for the leaderboard query above);
 * one that doesn't yet gets `id: null` instead of a fabricated serverId, which would create a
 * stray row a later REAL upload from that same server could never match back up with (see
 * matching/merge.ts's own upsertServer, which matches on this same (fingerprint, displayName)
 * pair). The frontend disables click-through for a null id rather than querying a leaderboard with
 * no serverId at all.
 *
 * serverCatalogId is the OTHER id a row carries, always present regardless of real uploads - per
 * the user, which instances even show up (GET /api/instances?serverCatalogId=...) differs by
 * server (Origin/EuroAion share one list, Riftshade's is wider), and that filter has to key off
 * something that exists before any upload does, which servers.id (possibly null here) cannot.
 *
 * `?game=` is accepted for compatibility (only aion2 exists).
