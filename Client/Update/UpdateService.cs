/// in on the next start, with no installer to run and no UAC prompt. That is the entire reason
/// the WiX/MSI packaging was dropped -- a per-machine install under Program Files is only
/// writable by an elevated process, and this app deliberately stopped asking for that when the
/// packet-capture path was removed.

/// find anything, which is indistinguishable from being up to date.
